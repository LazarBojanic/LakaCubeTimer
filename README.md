# WinterCubeTimer

Time your solves with generated WCA style scrambles, switch between sessions, +2, DNF or remove times, enable/disable inspection, live preview of the current scramble, see averages and best time, export the current cube state and scramble, and solve the cube using Kociemba.

Technologies: .NET 9.0, C# Winforms, SQLite, Kociemba (https://github.com/Megalomatt/Kociemba)

Instructions: You need .NET CORE 6 runtime to run the app and Python 3.x.x with the kociemba library in order for the cube solving to work. If you're cloning, then put times.db in the appropriate locations for your bin configuration eg: bin/Debug/net9.0-windows.
Otherwise, just download the latest release.
