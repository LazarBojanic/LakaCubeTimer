# LakaCubeTimer

Time your solves with generated WCA style scrambles, switch between sessions, +2, DNF or remove times, enable/disable inspection, live preview of the current scramble, see averages and best time, export the current cube state and scramble, and solve the cube using a Python script with the kociemba library.

Technologies: C# winforms, SQLite, Python 3 with kociemba for solving.

Instructions: If you're cloning, then put the times.db and solve.py files in the appropriate locations for your configuration eg: bin/x64/Release/net6.0-windows10.0.22621.0.
Otherwise just download the latest release. In both cases, you need python 3 installed with the kociemba library installed.
